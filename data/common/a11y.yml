  - subtitle: A11y in Mind
    copy: Accessibility, commonly shortened to a11y, may seem foreign at first but with some practice can become a part of day to day development. When building with accessibility keep in mind there are many different types of web accessibility, from visual to screen readers. Also, as you become more comfortable with creating accessible websites, you may come to realize, as I did, that accessibility and beautiful websites can go hand in hand. 
  - subtitle: Visual
    copy: Color contrast, typography, spacing, and boldness contribute to visual accessibility. When building your website be sure to test color contrast, choose a readable font, make headers bold, and set readable letter-spacing and line-height.
  - subtitle: Screen Readers
    copy: Keep in mind what it would be like to navigate your website with a screen reader. Are all  the links easily accessed? Can you tab through the content? Do all of your links and buttons have aria-labels if they need them? Keep these questions in mind as your read through some of the resources bellow.
